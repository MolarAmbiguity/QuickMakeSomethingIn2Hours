# QuickMakeSomethingIn2Hours

Made for IntoIT Hackathon 2015

Due to other commitments, I was only able to come to the hackathon for ~6 hours total.

I spent 3 hours on Sunday working on a app that scans barcodes to tell you whether you already own a movie.

Then I went to a surf carnival

Then I went to sleep

Then I woke up

Then I did a bronze medallion course

Then I came back to the Hackathon and made this.

I followed [this](http://www.osmstudios.com/tutorials/your-first-love2d-game-in-200-lines-part-1-of-3) tutorial:  and made a quite a few modifications. This was my first time using love and it was actually really fun.
